# Proxy list crawler

> Supposed to crawl proxy lists and save them to the database. This code is outdated
and needs fixing. Any contributions are welcome.

Current implementation is _outdated_, because this repo was re-imported
from an old project. The project was set up to work with Laravel 4.2.

The base logic is there, but the code needs to be cleaned up of missing classes.
